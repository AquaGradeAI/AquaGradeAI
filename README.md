### 🚀 **About Us**
We are a cutting-edge brand/startup that aims to revolutionize the seafood industry by utilizing advanced **AI-driven** technology to assess fish freshness. Our solution uses **visual cues** to determine freshness levels based on the **FAO's demeriting point system**.

The system helps buyers and sellers ensure that only the freshest products reach the market, minimizing food waste and improving quality standards.

### 🧑‍💻 **Project Overview**
This repository hosts the source code and resources for our fish freshness grading system. The project involves:

- **Visual Analysis:** Detecting fish features using **instance segmentation masks**.
- **Scoring System:** Grading fish freshness with the **FAO demeriting point system** (higher score = less fresh).
- **Tech Stack:** Built using modern web technologies such as **React.js**, **TailwindCSS**, **Node.js**, and _more!_
